### o ASSIGNMENT 1 (industrial talk of ICT jobs in CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD) 

This industrial talk, which was presented by CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD, was very helpful for all computer science students as it helped us understand a few computer science fieldÂ in greater detail. For instance, I was now aware of the qualifications required to work as a QA Testing Analyst, Android Developer, UI/UX Designer, or Web Developer. This will assist me in getting ready and improving my abilities before I eventually enter the workforce.

### o ASSIGNMENT 2 (Virtual talk and industrial visit to UTM DIGITAL)

***VIRTUAL TALK**

-After the virtual talk, i gained a lot of knowledge about UTM DIGITAL. They informed us about their services, what they did in order to give a UTM citizens a better and high quality of services, and the issues they needed to resolve.This has greatly expanded my understanding of the field of computer science.

***INDUSTRY VISIT** 

-After this visit, i can now envision what my future in the field of computer science will look like. They showed us around their workplace, meeting rooms, what it's like to work in a team, and how the working environments feels. Futhermore, i began to comprehend this course more fully because i learned a lot of ICT things from them, like how to maintain servers and how security system protect confidential data.  
 
### o ASSIGNMENT 3 (industrial talk : System development at CREDENCE (TM SUBSIDIARIY))

### o ASSIGNMENT 4 {industrial visit)

### o PC ASSEMBLE                                                                                                                                                                                            As a computer science major specializing in software engineering, it is not enough for me to be proficient in programming, coding, or software development; I also need to be well-versed in computer hardware.Therefore, in this PC Assembly, i have learnt how to reassemble and assemble PC. For instance, i now can take off the power supply, RAM, Fan and other parts also. As a result, I think this PC Assembly is incredibly beneficial for computer science students in order to produce high-quality employees. 

### o DESIGN THINKING ( FINAL PROJECT)
